# The SOLID principles

SOLID is an acronym that represents a set of five design principles in object-oriented programming. These principles aim to make software designs more maintainable, scalable, and easier to understand.

Let's look at each principle one by one. Following the SOLID acronym, they are:

1. The **S**ingle Responsibility Principle (SRP)
2. The **O**pen-Closed Principle (OCP)
3. The **L**iskov Substitution Principle (LSP)
4. The **I**nterface Segregation Principle (ISP)
5. The **D**ependency Inversion Principle (DIP)
