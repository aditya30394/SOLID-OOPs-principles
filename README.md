# The SOLID principles

SOLID is an acronym that represents a set of five design principles in object-oriented programming. These principles aim to make software designs more maintainable, scalable, and easier to understand.

We will now explore each principle individually, adhering to the SOLID acronym.

1. [The **S**ingle Responsibility Principle (SRP)](./SRP.md)
2. [The **O**pen-Closed Principle (OCP)](./OCP.md)
3. [The **L**iskov Substitution Principle (LSP)](./LSP.md)
4. [The **I**nterface Segregation Principle (ISP)](./ISP.md)
5. [The **D**ependency Inversion Principle (DIP)](./DIP.md)
